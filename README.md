> Why ?

I wanted to know if it was possible to implement an channel with unlimited capacity.

> Should you use it / Is it useful ?

No, but [here is an example](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pierrre/unlimited-channel#example-package).

> What about performance ?

It's slower than a normal channel.
